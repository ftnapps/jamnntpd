Changes in version 0.6

 - Configurable charset handling based on CHS files in the GoldED+ format. 
   
 - Greatly improved MIME-handling. JamNNTPd now handles both quoted-printable
   and base64 in both headers and message body when posting messages. Message
   headers containing non-ascii characters are encoded when displayed unless
   the -noencode option is used.

 - Now supports "quoting" with backslash as described in RFC-822.

 - JamNNTPd can now create an echomail.jam file that contains a list of all
   posted messages. The echomail.jam file can also be used as a semaphore.

 - A new -origin switch can be used to override the Organization line for
   the origin.
 
 - Support for TZUTC/TZUTCINFO kludges. JamNNTPd now creates a TZUTC kludge
   unless the -notzutc option is used. Thanks to Peter Karlsson for the patch.

 - Better parsing of configuration files. You can now use quotes for strings
   containing space characters. "" means an empty string.

 - It is now possible to override the From name on posts from authenticated
   users. It is also possible to specify a suffix that is added to the From
   name of all unauthenticated users using the -guestsuffix option.
   
 - Access groups are now case-insensitive. In addition, "*" now means all 
   groups and "-" means no groups.

 - The -smartquote option no longer removes initial space characters from 
   quoted text and inserts incorrect initials.
 
 - Fixed broken response code of NEWGROUPS command.

 - The LIST ACTIVE and LIST OVERVIEW.FMT commands are now also supported.

 - JamNNTPd now displays an X-Comment-To header line.

 - The signature delimiter "-- " is no longer reflowed when posting with
   format=flowed. Fixed display problems with long lines without spaces 
   and format=flowed.

 - All characters <32 are removed in the output of the XOVER command to
   prevent problems.

 - Increased the maximum size for posts from 10 000 bytes to 20 000 bytes.

 - JamNNTPd no longer crashes when an area cannot be opened.

 - JamNNTPd no longer crashes when trying to display messages with blank 
   JAMSFLD_FTSKLUDGE fields in the XOVER command.
  
 - The body text of posts that started with a blank line were lost in 
   previous versions. This has now been fixed.

 - Upgraded JAMLIB to version 1.3.2.
      
 - Other minor fixes and improvements.
 
Changes in version 0.5

 - Superfluous space characters are now removed when lines are joined when
   posting using format=flowed.

 - Implemented quote reformatting (-smartquote switch)

 - Changed % to $ in Message-Id and References line.

 - XOVER didn't work in groups with only one message. Fixed.

 - JAMLIB is now included in the JamNNTPd archive and no longer needs to be
   downloaded separately.

 - Simplified the compilation process. Now "make linux" or "make win32" in
   the src directory is enough.
