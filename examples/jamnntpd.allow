# Allowed IP numbers for JamNNTPd
#
# Syntax:
#
# <ip> <default read access groups> <default post access groups>
#
# If no access groups are configured, users connecting from that IP will
# not be able to access any newsgroups.
#
# "*" can be used as a wildcard. Everything after "*" is ignored, i. e.
# 127.0.*.1 is equivalent to 127.0.*. Just write "*" alone on a line to
# allow all IP numbbers.
#                    
127.0.0.1   AX    A
